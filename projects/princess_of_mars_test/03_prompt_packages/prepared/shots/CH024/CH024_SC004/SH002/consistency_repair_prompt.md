# Continuity Notes
- Scene: CH024_SC004 / SC004.
- Variant: Consistency Repair.
- Physical state (wounds/exhaustion) of the duelists
- Shifting hierarchy and seating arrangements in the chamber
- A sanctioned duel is established between Tars Tarkas and Tal Hajus.
- Keep the prompt compact enough for ComfyUI text prompt enhancers to expand safely.
