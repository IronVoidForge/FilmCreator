# Continuity Notes
- Scene: CH022_SC001 / SC001.
- Variant: Tighter Zoom.
- Carter's physical position relative to the tapestry must remain consistent.
- Maintain strict control over Carter's visibility/concealment from the royal party (Than Kosis, Sab Than, Dejah Thoris).
- Dejah Thoris publicly pledges herself to Sab Than to maintain peace between warring cities.
- Keep the prompt compact enough for ComfyUI text prompt enhancers to expand safely.
