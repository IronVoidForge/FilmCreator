# Continuity Notes
- Scene: CH006_SC003 / SC003.
- Variant: Tighter Zoom.
- Level of dirt/blood on the protagonist must remain consistent with post-combat state
- Proximity of dead apes to the character group must be maintained for spatial logic
- Martian warriors and Tars Tarkas arrive at the scene to witness the aftermath.
- Keep the prompt compact enough for ComfyUI text prompt enhancers to expand safely.
