# Continuity Notes
- Scene: CH025_SC002 / SC002.
- Variant: Tighter Zoom.
- Blood splatter patterns must remain consistent with combat positions
- Precise positioning of fallen bodies (Sab Than, Than Kosis, Guards)
- Weapon states (broken/used) across battle beats
- Lighting shifts due to potential smoke or dust accumulation in the chamber
- Keep the prompt compact enough for ComfyUI text prompt enhancers to expand safely.
